Various sensors can be applyed for soil properties measurments. In this study we measured the soil properties by standard methods in the lab (K, Mg, P)to be used as reference values. A Tech5 Visible spectrometer 
and a Hamamatsu Near Infrared spectrometer also a Handheld thermofisher XL3t analyser was used to measure the same soil properties. The spectra from Vis-NIR was calibrated by Nested cross-validation model and 
predictions were made based on reference properties. These interactive plots aim to compare the trend of changes of K, Mg, and P in various depths of the soil measured by these methods. However, we should know
the measured values from XRF method are elemental concentration and can not be aliged with Vis-NIR or Reference values.
